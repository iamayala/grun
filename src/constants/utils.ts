Once you've gained some speed, press down on the throttle near your right thumb to accelerate. \n\nNote: In select markets, you can limit the top speed of your scooter via the app to learn at a comfortable pace. This option is displayed during the trip. \n\nWe recommend you familiarize yourself with the throttle to understand how to adjust your speed. To slow down, squeeze the hand brake.",
